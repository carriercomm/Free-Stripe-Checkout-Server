Stripe Server
----------------------------

[Try it out here](https://henrygd.me/stripeserver) - No percentage fees or other costs, ever.

This tool will allow your static website to complete Stripe Checkout transactions without a server and without leaving your site. I made it as a companion to a website generator for nonprofits, and it is intended for owners of smaller, serverless websites (including github.io) that want to -- for instance -- accept donations. If you have a webstore that sells dozens or hundreds of items each day, however, setting up your own server is probably the better option.

Specific callbacks will be added soon. Contributions are welcome.
