Free Stripe Checkout Server
----------------------------

[Try it out here](https://henrygd.me/stripeserver) - No percentage fees or other costs, ever.

Allows your static website to complete Stripe Checkout transactions without a server and without forcing users to leave your site. I made it as a companion to a website builder for nonprofits, and it is intended for owners of smaller, serverless websites (including github.io) that want to, for instance, accept donations. If you have a store that sells dozens or hundreds of items each day, however, setting up your own server is probably the better option.
